# Classy Chirpr Lab

The goal of this lab is to recreate the Chirpr Lab assignment but use React's Class system instead of the more recent Hooks.

## Instructions (same as before)
Your objective should be to create a "timeline" of Chirps -- short messages that you post on the Chirper platform.

Your timeline should load with at least three chirps.

Code a form with at least two inputs where users can submit new chirps from.

When a new chirp is submitted it should be shown back to the user in the timeline.

 
## Hints
The walkthrough and lecture's reference material will serve as a great guide to completing this lab.
Remember that a lot of your code will start with `this`. inside of a class.
Remember to bind your `this` keyword by using arrow functions in your event handlers
